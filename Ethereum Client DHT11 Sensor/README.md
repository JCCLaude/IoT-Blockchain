These are the files that send the values of a DHT11 sensor to an Ethereum Blockchain and register them there. 
The DHT11 sensor measures the temperature and humidity and using the Python script "measure_dht11_sensor.py" the values measured 
by the sensor are sent to the javascript script "data_transmission_dht11_sensor.js".
The Javascript script "data_transmission_dht11_sensor.js" enters the measured values in the blockchain. 
The Python script "measure_save_file.py" allows saving the measured values in a file.
